Letâ€™s break it into two parts:

1. Create a Dockerfile (so you can run Ubuntu with everything you need).


2. Commit and push the repo from Codespace to GitHub.

1. Creating a Dockerfile

Inside your repo directory in the Codespace, create a file named Dockerfile:

touch Dockerfile

Edit the Dockerfile (you can use the built-in editor or nano):

# Use official Ubuntu as the base image
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Avoid interactive prompts during install
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Update and install common tools
RUN apt update && apt install -y \
    bash \
    curl \
    git \
    build-essential \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /workspace

# By default, start a bash shell
CMD ["/bin/bash"]

Now build the Docker image:

docker build -t my-ubuntu-image .

Run it with your repo directory mounted:

docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace my-ubuntu-image

2. Committing & Pushing the Repo from Codespace

After creating the Dockerfile, you need to push everything to your GitHub repo.

Step-by-step commands:

# Check current branch
git branch

# Stage all changes (including Dockerfile)
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Add Dockerfile for Ubuntu dev environment"

# Push to GitHub (for the first push of a branch, include -u)
git push -u origin main

After running these, your Dockerfile will be in your GitHub repo.
